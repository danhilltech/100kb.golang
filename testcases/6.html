            <p>Many programmers subscribe to the belief that they need large blocks of uninterrupted time to get
                anything done. Paul Graham wrote about this in <a
                    href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Maker&#8217;s Schedule, Manager&#8217;s Schedule</a>:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&#8217;re on a different type of schedule
                    from other people. Meetings cost them more.</p>
                <p>[Programmers] generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can&#8217;t write or
                    program well in units of an hour. That&#8217;s barely enough time to get started.</p>
                <p>When you&#8217;re operating on the maker&#8217;s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting
                    can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love having a whole afternoon to work on something without interruption.
                It&#8217;s probably ideal for most people. But it&#8217;s an exaggeration to say that it&#8217;s
                <em>impossible</em> to program well in units of an hour.</p>
            <h2>Parent&#8217;s schedule</h2>
            <p>Last summer, my wife and I had our third child. Before we had kids, I&#8217;d sometimes spend a full day
                â€” or even a weekend â€” working on a fun programming project. But now, with three kids and a full-time
                job, I&#8217;m lucky to find a half dozen free hours spread out across the week.</p>
            <p>My primary side project is <a href="https://ohmjs.org">Ohm</a>, a parsing toolkit for JavaScript.
                I&#8217;ve been working on it since 2015, and been the sole maintainer since 2017. Since our third child
                was born, I&#8217;ve managed to ship:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a new <a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/ohm-v16/">major version</a></li>
                <li>three minor versions with various bug fixes and new features</li>
                <li>a <a href="https://ohmjs.org">brand new web site</a> for the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&#8230;and about 75% of the time I invested in this was in increments of one hour or less, when my kids
                were sleeping.</p>
            <p>Trying to get work done this way was certainly a big adjustment, but I managed to develop some habits and
                find some tricks that made it work for me. Obviously I can&#8217;t say that what works for me would work
                for everyone. But like almost everything in life, I&#8217;m pretty sure most people can improve
                significantly through practice.</p>
            <h2>Some useful tactics</h2>
            <p>Here are some things that I found to be helpful (caveat lector, YMMV, and all that) â€”</p>
            <p><strong>Make progress every day.</strong> A few things (like minor bugs) might take less than an hour.
                But most things worth doing take longer, which means that I can&#8217;t finish them in a single sitting.
                On those things, I try to make a little progress every day â€” even if it&#8217;s only 20 or 30 minutes.
                It keeps the cache warm: if I work on something early in the morning, I&#8217;ll keep thinking about it
                over the course of the day. Then, if I have another half hour at the end of the day, the problem is
                still pretty fresh in my head.</p>
            <p>I&#8217;m not strict about <em>when</em> I do the work. Sometimes I&#8217;ll work in the early morning
                (~6am, right after making coffee), and sometimes in the evening (9â€“10pm). The most important thing is to
                make a little progress every day.</p>
            <p><strong>Always know what the next thing to do is.</strong> For me, this means having either a clear end
                goal (e.g., fix this bug, make this test green) or a concrete next step (e.g., change all callers of
                <em>wiggle</em> to call <em>waggle</em>). If I plan this ahead of time, then when I sit down at my
                computer, I can immediately get to work.</p>
            <p>I was never a huge fan of test-driven development, but I do find it helpful in this context. Once I have
                a failing test, I find it much easier to resume the work again later. And writing the test helps me
                figure out the next manageable unit of progress.</p>
            <p>If I need to stop working right in the middle of something, sometimes I leave a note directly in the
                source code, like this:</p>
            <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-js">  TODO make sure examinedLength is properly calculated here!
  const origPos = inputStream.pos;
  if (!inputStream.matchString(this.obj)) {
    ...
  }</code></pre>


            <p>This will cause a syntax error the next time I run the tests, which reminds me of what I need to do next.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pay attention to feedback loops.</strong> When working in such small increments, I find fast
                feedback to be even more important than usual. Depending on what I&#8217;m working on, this might mean
                unit tests, <a href="https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin">fast refresh</a> for React
                stuff, or using <a href="https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec">watchexec</a> to automatically re-run a
                script.</p>
            <p><strong>For bigger things, make a plan and keep a log.</strong> When I&#8217;m starting a more complex
                task, like a performance investigation or a big refactoring, I take 10-15 minutes to write down a plan
                before I start the work. Nothing fancy, just a few bullet points in a text file. And when I get
                interrupted, I take 30 seconds to summarize my progress and any next steps I should take.</p>
            <p>I find that planning my work this way also makes me more effective. When I had big blocks of
                uninterrupted time, I would usually just dive into a refactoring without thinking it through too deeply.
                But when I sit down to plan things out in detail, I often realize that I&#8217;m missing a critical
                detail and need to adjust my plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Block distractions.</strong> If I&#8217;m not careful, I can fall into a habit of checking
                Twitter, HN, etc. as soon as I sit down at my computer. This can easily waste 20 or 30 minutes at the
                start of a working session. If I&#8217;ve only got an hour, it&#8217;s half gone.</p>
            <p>When I blocked those sites on my computer, I found it much easier to get into a focused state quickly. It
                also prevents me from quickly checking command-tabbing to the browser whenever I&#8217;m stuck too long
                on something tricky (which I&#8217;m also guilty of).</p>
            <p class="dinkus"></p>

            <p>Most of these things I learned the hard way, as I struggled to try to get things done in the limited free
                time that I had. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything groundbreaking here, just a few small things
                that have made a difference for me. Maybe they&#8217;re useful to you, too.</p>
            <p>Beyond the tactics, I suspect that practice is also important here. JB Rainsberger suggests that <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/1504836590941655046">using the Pomodoro technique will
                    train you to achieve focus quickly</a>. I&#8217;ve used it off and on over the past couple years;
                it&#8217;s possible that helped as well.</p>
