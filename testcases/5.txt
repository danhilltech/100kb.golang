Parental struggles during school closures
As the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020, Canada plunged into a deep economic recession. The employment rate decreased from around 61% to just over 52% within the first two months, and unemployment peaked at about 14% in April 2020. Remarkably, by the fall of 2021, Canada’s labor market had returned to pre-COVID levels. However, this overall economic resilience obscures the specific, acute challenges faced by certain groups, particularly parents with young children, during the temporary school closures. Many parents experienced intense stress due to the constant juggling between work and childcare responsibilities, and this underlines a critical area that needs more attention. In my last blog post, I would like to highlight the importance of implementing supportive policies that can alleviate such burdens on parents. 
The closure of schools as a social distancing measure was intended to reduce COVID-19 transmission, but research suggests that these closures may not have significantly impacted virus spread. More importantly, the closure of schools had unintended consequences on children’s well-being and their parents’ ability to work. This trade-off was not thoroughly evaluated during the implementation of school closure policies. 
Research has extensively covered the effects of school closures on children worldwide, yet the impact on parents, especially single parents, remains under-studied. In Canada, about 30% of prime-age workers have children under 13, requiring extra care when schools are closed. Other pandemic restrictions, such as stay-at-home orders, compounded these challenges by limiting access to alternative childcare. This situation led to reduced working hours and productivity for many parents, even amidst remote working policies, potentially causing long-term career disparities. Moreover, the burden of childcare often falls disproportionately on mothers, potentially exacerbating existing gender gaps in the labor market.  
Recent studies in Canada show an increase in employment rates among parents with primary school-aged children following the reopening of schools. The effect was most pronounced among single mothers. Parents also generally worked more hours once schools reopened. These findings highlight the need to enhance childcare support and encourage policies that promote gender equality in caregiving responsibilities during crises. Addressing these issues can also help mitigate the impact on single mothers and single fathers. 
As Canada and the world continue to navigate the aftermath of the pandemic, it’s vital to recognize and address the unique challenges faced by parents, especially during periods of economic downturn. Comprehensive research and thoughtful policies catering to their needs are essential. Such measures will not only provide support during times of crisis but will also pave the way for a more inclusive and resilient economy.
